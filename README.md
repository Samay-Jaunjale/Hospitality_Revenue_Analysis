My First Power BI Dashboard – Hospitality Revenue Analysis 🚀

In today’s competitive hospitality industry, data-driven decisions are crucial for revenue growth and customer satisfaction. Excited to share my first Power BI project, where I analyzed the revenue and booking trends of AtliQ Grands, a five-star hotel chain.

📌 Project Overview:
AtliQ Grands has been struggling with declining revenue and increasing competition. To improve decision-making, they turned to Business and Data Intelligence but lacked an in-house analytics team. My task was to analyze their historical data and create a Power BI dashboard to uncover key insights.

📊 What I Did:
✅ Defined key revenue metrics (RevPAR, ADR, Occupancy %)
✅ Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize trends
✅ Explored DAX functions for dynamic calculations and deeper insights

🔍 Key Findings:
📈 Revenue trends across different cities and properties
🏨 Occupancy rates by room category (Luxury vs. Business)
📅 Booking patterns (Weekday vs. Weekend performance)
💳 Impact of cancellations on revenue

This project gave me a strong foundation in Power BI and DAX functions, helping me understand how data analytics drives business decisions.
